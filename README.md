## Rules

The objective is to match all of the cards. The deck contains eight pairs of matching images on the cards. The cards are shuffled when the window loads and when player pushes reset to being a new game. When player clicks the first card, the timer and move count starts. Once two cards are flipped, if they match they will remain turned over. If they do not match they will no longer show. The game is over when all the cards have been matched. 

## Score
Every two cards flipped is one move. After 16 moves one star will be removed from the score panel; leaving a two star rating. After 32 moves another star will be removed from the score panel; leaving a one star rating.
